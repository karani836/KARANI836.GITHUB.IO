THE WORLD IS FULL OF BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE THINGS: FOR INSTANCE HUMANS HAVE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH IN THE CREATION OF AI WHICH HAS PROVED TO BE SMARTER AND CREATIVE THAN ITS CREATORS
THEREFORE HAS DISPLACED HUMAN FROM THEIR WORK HENCE RENDERING PEOPLE JOBLESS
HUMANS HAVE HAD THEIR FILL WITH WORK SINCE THEY HEAVILY OVERDEPEND ON ROBOTS....
ITS IRONIC HOW HUMANS CAN CREATE SOMETHING THAT DISPLACES THEM OF THEIR DAILY WORK AND THEN COMPLAIN OF UNEMPLOYMENT
.....................................................
THAT BEING SAID HUMANS NEED TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT TECHNOLOGY ALSO HAVE ITS CONS.....
............
TECHNOLLGY HAS MADE WORK  EASIER FOR HUMANS...WE CAN SEE THE CONTRIBUTION OF INTERNET IN COMMUNICATION,RESEARCH WORK,MEDICINE MANUFACTURE ETC...
